# KarateGraph_and_NeuralNets

[`Basic introduction to graphs, neural networks and graph neural networks.ipynb`](https://github.com/olszewskip/KarateGraph_and_NeuralNets/blob/master/Basic%20introduction%20to%20graphs%2C%20neural%20networks%20and%20graph%20neural%20networks.ipynb) is a Jupyter-notebook of python code snippets reachly intertwined with commentary, that:
* showcases graph manipulation and plotting with `networkx` and `python-igraph`,
* uses [`GEM`](https://github.com/palash1992/GEM) package for graph-embeddings,
* introduces basics of `pytorch` for defining a (graph) neural network,
* follows the discussion in http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/ to use a neural network to propagate labels through the canonical Zachary's karate network,
* lists useful resources for further development and study.

The notebook was exported as an [`html`](https://github.com/olszewskip/KarateGraph_and_NeuralNets/blob/master/Basic%20introduction%20to%20graphs%2C%20neural%20networks%20and%20graph%20neural%20networks.html) for ease of viewing (locally) but You are encouraged to run the notebook Yourself.

You can find versions of the used python packages in the `environment.yml` file generated by `conda`.

To use the `node2vec` embedding from the [`GEM`](https://github.com/palash1992/GEM) package, I've downloaded the `SNAP` library from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/install.html) without much hassle.

In order to have the `python-igraph` package not complain during plotting, I've installed it via `conda install -c conda-forge python-igraph`.
