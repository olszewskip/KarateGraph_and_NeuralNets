# KarateGraph_and_NeuralNets
`Basic introduction to graphs, neural networks and graph neural networks.ipynb` is a Jupyter-notebook of python code snippets reachly intertwined with commentary, that:
* showcases graph manipulation and plotting with `networkx` and `python-igraph`
* uses `GEM` package for graph-embeddings
* introduces basics of `pytorch` for defining a (graph) neural network
* follows the discussion in http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/ to use a neural network to propagate labels through the canonical Zachary's karate network

You can find version of the used python packages in the `environment.yml` file generated by `conda`.

To use the `node2vec` embedding from the [`GEM`](https://github.com/palash1992/GEM) package, I've downloaded the `SNAP` library from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/install.html) without much hassle.

In order to have the `python-igraph` packahe not complain suring plotting, I've installed it via `conda install -c conda-forge python-igraph`
